To convert your script to work with Wayland and bemenu, you need to replace dmenu with bemenu. Here's your modified script:

sh

#!/bin/sh

# A bemenu wrapper script for downloading presently watched video and organizing them into distinct folders within ~/Videos

archive_file="$HOME/Videos/archive"
# Prompt the URL
video_url=$(echo "" | bemenu -p "Enter the URL of the video you'd like to download. CTRL-Y to paste")

videos_dir="$HOME/Videos/"
subfolders=$(find "$videos_dir" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec basename {} \; | sort)
selected_folder=$(echo -e "$subfolders" | bemenu -p "Select destination folder for download:")

destination="$videos_dir$selected_folder/"

echo "Downloading video to $destination"
yt-dlp --download-archive "$archive_file" -P "${destination}" "$video_url"
echo "Download complete!"
